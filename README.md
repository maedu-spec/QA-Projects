"In the same way artists make arts that moves the soul, I aim to test software with the same depth, detail, and emotion. This isn't just about checking boxes, it's about protecting user joy.  Welcome to my playground, a collection of real-world-inspired testing projects where I explore how functionality meets experience. Each section of this portfolio represents a different body of arts — focused on API testing, manual exploratory testing, bug reporting, and thoughtful documentation.

Here, you'll find:
- API test projects (Postman, mock servers,public APIs)
- Real bug reports from hands-on exploration
- Functional test cases for common user flows
- Lessons learned, testing insights, and personal growth moments

This is a living document of my growth as a QA professional, from manual testing to test automation, from reporting bugs to telling stories that help teams ship better products. Whether you're a recruiter, hiring manager, teammate, or fellow learner, thank you for being here.

Let’s dive in.
